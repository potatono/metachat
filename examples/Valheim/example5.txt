{streamer_name}: Does anyone know the best food for stamina?
{bot_name}: the best stamina foods are fish n' bread, mushroom omelette, and salad
{bot_name}: you can make fish n' bread with angler fish and bread dough, but those fish are rare
{bot_name}: the mushroom omlette takes egg and jotun puffs
{bot_name}: the salad is easiest to make.  it only needs jotun puffs, onion and cloudberries
{bot_name}: what the heck is a cloudberry anyway?
